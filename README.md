## Expo Image Component Error: Unclear Error Message on Image Load Failure

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo's `Image` component:  unhelpful error messages when image loading fails.  The problem is often due to incorrect URIs or network connectivity issues, but the error itself doesn't clearly specify the problem.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of how this error can occur, while `bugSolution.js` provides several solutions.
