To fix this, carefully check the following:

1. **URI Validation:** Ensure the URI you are using is correctly formatted and points to an accessible image.  Common issues include typos or missing protocol (`http://` or `https://`).
2. **Network Connectivity:** Verify your device or emulator has a stable internet connection.  Try loading the image in a browser to see if it's accessible.
3. **Image Existence:** Check if the image file actually exists at the specified URI.  If using a remote server, make sure it's correctly configured and responding.
4. **Placeholder/Fallback:** Add a placeholder image to display while loading, or in case of error:
   ```javascript
   <Image
     source={{ uri: imageUri }}
     style={styles.image}
     onError={(e) => console.error('Error loading image:', e)}
     onLoadStart={() => setPlaceholder(true)} // Show placeholder while loading
     onLoadEnd={() => setPlaceholder(false)} // Hide placeholder once image is loaded
   />
   {placeholder && <PlaceholderImage style={styles.placeholder} />}
   ```
5. **Caching:** Ensure proper image caching is handled by Expo, or consider using a third-party library for more advanced caching mechanisms.
6. **HTTPS:** If using HTTPS, verify the SSL certificate of the server.  If you're using a self-signed certificate, you might need to add an exception in your app settings.

Implementing these solutions will help in identifying the source of the image loading issue and preventing such vague errors.
